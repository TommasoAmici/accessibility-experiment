\section{Research method}

Initially I intended to conduct interviews or a survey, but I now realize that it would
be hard for me to find enough respondents that both are Internet users and self-identify
as disabled.

I now plan on collecting data from social media and conduct my analysis on that data. I
hope to find evidence of users citing web accessibility when expressing their desire for
avoidance, e.g. \url{https://twitter.com/smrtshygoodguy/status/1485288775467114503}.

In order to establish the relative impact of such complaints, I plan on collecting data
about complaints in general to see how many are related to accessibility.
