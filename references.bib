  abstract  = {The Web is providing unprecedented access to information and interaction for people with disabilities. It provides opportunities to participate in society in ways otherwise not available. With accessible websites, people with disabilities can do ordinary things:children can learn, teenagers can flirt, adults can make a living, seniors can read about their grand- children, and so on. With the Web, people with disabilities can do more things themselves, without having to rely on others. People who are blind can read the newspaper (through screen readers that read aloud text from the computer), and so can people with cognitive disabilities who have trouble processing written information. People who are deaf can get up-to-the-minute news that was previously available only to those who could hear radio or TV, and so can people who are blind and deaf (through dynamic Braille displays). People with quadriplegia who cannot move their arms or legs can shop online to get groceries, gadgets, and gifts delivered. People who cannot speak can participate in online discus- sions, such as through blog comments.},

  abstract = {Whereas recent research has demonstrated the impact of online product ratings and reviews on product sales, we still have a limited understanding of the individual's decision to contribute these opinions. In this research, we empirically model the individual's decision to provide a product rating and investigate factors that influence this decision. Specifically, we consider how previously posted ratings may affect an individual's posting behavior in terms of whether to contribute (incidence) and what to contribute (evaluation), and we identify selection effects that influence the incidence decision and adjustment effects that influence the evaluation decision. Across individuals, our results show that positive ratings environments increase posting incidence, whereas negative ratings environments discourage posting. Our results also indicate important differences across individuals in how they respond to previously posted ratings, with less frequent posters exhibiting bandwagon behavior and more active customers revealing differentiation behavior. These dynamics affect the evolution of online product opinions. Through simulations, we illustrate how the evolution of posted product opinions is shaped by the underlying customer base and show that customer bases with the same median opinion may evolve in substantially different ways because of the presence of a core group of “activists” posting increasingly negative opinions.},

We present the results of accessibility testing of 100 websites with 51 disabled users that should dispel this belief. While there are aspects of accessibility that do affect visual design, such as visual structure, colour contrast and text size, these are aspects of design that can affect all users, not only disabled users. These design concerns must be considered if both the users' experience and business objectives are to be met.},

  abstract = {Objective:We examined the consequences of implementing Web accessibility guidelines for nondisabled users.Background:Although there are Web accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities available, they are rarely used in practice, partly due to the fact that practitioners believe that such guidelines provide no benefits, or even have negative consequences, for nondisabled people, who represent the main user group of Web sites. Despite these concerns, there is a lack of empirical research on the effects of current Web accessibility guidelines on nondisabled users.Method:Sixty-one nondisabled participants used one of three Web sites differing in levels of accessibility (high, low, and very low). Accessibility levels were determined by following established Web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0). A broad methodological approach was used, including performance measures (e.g., task completion time) and user ratings (e.g., perceived usability).Results:A high level of Web accessibility led to better performance (i.e., task completion time and task completion rate) than low or very low accessibility. Likewise, high Web accessibility improved user ratings (i.e., perceived usability, aesthetics, workload, and trustworthiness) compared to low or very low Web accessibility. There was no difference between the very low and low Web accessibility conditions for any of the outcome measures.Conclusion:Contrary to some concerns in the literature and among practitioners, high conformance with Web accessibility guidelines may provide benefits to users without disabilities.Application:The findings may encourage more practitioners to implement WCAG 2.0 for the benefit of users with disabilities and nondisabled users.},

@article{williams2006,
  abstract = {Abstract The easy exchange of rich information between often geographically dispersed parties is an important precursor of successful tourism transactions. Internet-based technologies, in particular the World Wide Web, offer possibilities to both buyers and sellers to exchange information without the constraints of geography and time diminishing its richness. The disabled, representing a significant part of any marketplace, may, however, have difficulties accessing the content of the Web and therefore sharing the benefits of rich information exchange. This is the principal concern of ‘Web content accessibility’. Focusing on the tourism sector, in particular UK-based hotels, this paper examines the accessibility of their websites. However, recognising that it is not just access to information that is important for the disabled, but also the quality of that information, the paper also examines the extent to which the information contained on websites serves their particular needs. Utilising the accessibility testing software ‘Bobby’, disappointingly low levels of Web content accessibility were found amongst the sample of websites. Against a framework of information needs developed from criteria provided by disability organisations, the sample also revealed disappointingly low levels of specific (relevant) information for the disabled.

  abstract = {Online comments have become an important tool for disabled guests because of lower physical movement requirements. In order to illustrate and evaluate disabled guests' decision-making characteristics, this paper has used two steps for studying: (1) Data mining technology to collect e-comments from C-trip (www.ctrip.com) of 97 hotels in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Guangzhou. Over 260,000 words were collected and analyzed by using ROSTcm software for this research. (2) Examined the relationship between the credibility and the perceived risk of disabled guests for their behavioral intentions. The result of this study has showed that: (1) Disabled guests pay more attention to the hotel barrier-free facilities, hotel barrier-free facilities, hotel personalized service, location accessibility, and the attitude and atmosphere of the hotel. (2) Disabled guests show positive attitude towards the hotel, and a neutral attitude accounting for 25.86{\%} which indicates that the hotel industry still has much improving room especially with regards to disabled accessible guestrooms and accessibility. (3) Electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) source credibility has a great influence on the overall perceived risk of the review of disabled guests because they are more likely for seeking internet comments for their lodging decision-making than other common guests. eWOM rational management can reduce the overall potential risk for disabled guests. (4) Hotels can enhance disabled guests' decision-making by advanced eWOM management. The study illustrated that disabled guests who used eWOM could be better managed and reduce potential risks when making decisions. As a result, this study also found that with better management of eWOM, it could help to meet the potential market for the disabled guests and at the meanwhile attract more customers because of higher social reputation.},
