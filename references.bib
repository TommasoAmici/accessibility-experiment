  abstract = {Abstract The authors investigate the impact of satisfaction on loyalty in the context of electronic commerce. Findings of this research indicate that although e-satisfaction has an impact on e-loyalty, this relationship is moderated by (a) consumers' individual level factors and (b) firms' business level factors. Among consumer level factors, convenience motivation and purchase size were found to accentuate the impact of e-satisfaction on e-loyalty, whereas inertia suppresses the impact of e-satisfaction on e-loyalty. With respect to business level factors, both trust and perceived value, as developed by the company, significantly accentuate the impact of e-satisfaction on e-loyalty. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract  = {A huge amount of content has been made available on the Web. Although there are several initiatives to guide an accessible web development, researchers have showed that web developers are rarely aware of accessibility issues in their web projects. In this paper, we conducted a survey to verify the evolution of web accessibility awareness in Brazil. We have conducted an exploratory study based on web questionnaire, using a self-selected and non-probabilistic sampling method. The study had 404 valid answers, covering all regions of Brazil. The results show that most of participants has never developed an accessible website and 33.2% of them are not worried about considering accessibility in their future projects. Therefore, it is important to create public policies that improve the current web accessibility scenario, raising the awareness of the people involved in web development, as well as obligating compliance with Brazilian legislation.},

The multitude of company websites within the global system present varying linguistic, cultural and communication characteristics, which determine different experiences depending on the local culture of the user. The design of culturally appropriate websites is viewed as essential to communication, mainly for marketing. This article therefore aims at analysing the impact of cultural characteristics on web design and marketing communication. China presents a vast market and internet population, with specific cultural characteristics, and for these reasons is the subject chosen for study. The study develops a methodology based on an adaptation of Hofstede’s and Hall’s cultural dimensions for purposes of analysing website content. The methodology makes it possible to measure the projection of underlying cultural characteristics in website design.The content analysis of 75 websites Chinese companies quoted on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets reveals that their design reflects local cultural characteristics. Furthermore, the analysis of the Chinese and English versions of the websites reveals that there the latter provide virtually no adaptation to an international clientele, particularly as concerns the indicators of Collectivism, Uncertainty Avoidance and Long Term Orientation.},

The user's experience of the website played a moderating role. For less experienced users, perceived ease of use was found to be a more important factor in deciding to revisit the website, whereas perceived usefulness had more effect on more experienced users. Thus, web designers can identify and remove web factors that hinder user acceptance and address underlying obstacles to post-adoption usage. The novelty of the study consisted in applying TAM to a free-content website while considering the moderating effects of Internet and website experience. Significant practical implications can be derived from the results.},

In particular, the present study tries to determine which the Aaker's (1991) brand equity dimensions have the mediating roles between source credible online reviews and purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from select e-commerce site's brand community on Facebook social media platform through Google form application. The present study first determines the reliability of the variables. To check the unidimensionality of the variables, exploratory factor analysis has been performed. This study makes use of structural equation modeling bootstrapping method to examine the mediating effects of brand equity dimensions between source credible online reviews and purchase intention. Findings Data analysis reveals that marketers should concentrate more on brand awareness and perceived value, which ultimately influence the purchase intention of the consumers. Originality/value This paper is one of the first that examines the mediating effects of consumer-based brand equity dimensions between source credible online reviews and consumer's purchase intention. Further, the present study integrates source credibility theory and attribution theory to develop the research model.},

In the current investigation, three components of Web site design (information design, navigation design, and visual design) are considered for their impact on trust and satisfaction. In turn, relationships of trust and satisfaction to online loyalty are evaluated. Utilizing data collected from 571 participants in Canada, Germany, and China, various relationships in the research model are tested using partial least squares analysis for each country separately. In addition, the overall model is tested for all countries combined as a control and verification of earlier research findings, although this time with a mixed country sample. All paths in the overall model are confirmed. Differences are determined for separate country samples concerning whether navigation design, visual design, and information design result in trust, satisfaction, and ultimately loyalty-suggesting design characteristics should be a central consideration in Web site design across cultures.},

Motivation for the investigation includes: (1) to test and compare user reactions to website design in countries with different degrees of uncertainty avoidance, (2) to consider user reactions based on country economic and technological conditions related to the theory of institutional trust and social capital, and (3) to extend clustering theory and the GLOBE cultural cluster model to determine if culturally similar countries group regarding user perceptions of websites. Overall and as predicted, users in low uncertainty avoidance, high institutional trust and social capital countries such as Canada and the USA have the most favorable perceptions of website design. An interesting finding is that while country economic and technological conditions may temper user perceptions in some instances, overall culture is a stronger predictor. Clustering theory is a useful determinant of user perceptions, and there is strong support that users within a given cultural cluster have similar requirements regarding website design.},

Each participant was independently provided a list of 21 tasks to complete, with each task rated as either easily completed/noncritical error or critical error (user cannot complete the task without significant interviewer intervention).Results Twelve participants completed formal usability testing. Median completion time for all tasks was 17.5 minutes (range=10{\textendash}44 minutes). In total, 10 participants had greater than or equal to one critical error. There were 55 critical errors in 252 tasks (22\%), with the highest proportion of critical errors occurring when participants were asked to find information on treatments that may damage kidneys, find the website on the internet, increase font size, and scroll to the bottom of the webpage. Participants were generally satisfied with the content and usability of the website.Conclusions Web-based educational materials for patients with CKD should target a wide range of computer literacy levels and anticipate variability in competency in use of the computer and internet.},

They may face possible fears from online transactions raised by their risk perception about financial or privacy loss. They may have concerns over the payment decision with the possible negative behaviors such as shopping cart abandonment. Therefore, customers have three major players that need to be addressed in online payment: the online seller, the payment page, and their own perception. However, few studies have explored these three players in an online purchasing environment. In this paper, we focus on the customer concerns and examine the antecedents of trust, payment security perception as well as their joint effect on two fundamentally important customers' aspects privacy concerns and financial fear perception. A total of 392 individuals participated in an online survey. The results highlight the importance, of the seller website's components (such as ease of use, security signs, and quality information) and their impact on the perceived payment security as well as their impact on customer's trust and financial fear perception.

The emotions of liking and joy were experienced intensively by a substantial number of shoppers. The results also demonstrate that interface features – key components of the usability of a Web site – influenced the three cognitive appraisals illustrated in the research model. Moreover, the cognitive appraisals of situational state and control potential impacted the six emotions examined.

  abstract  = {A separate and distinct interaction with both the actual e-vendor and with its IT Web site interface is at the heart of online shopping. Previous research has established, accordingly, that online purchase intentions are the product of both consumer assessments of the IT itself-specifically its perceived usefulness and ease-of-use (TAM)-and trust in the e-vendor. But these perspectives have been examined independently by IS researchers. Integrating these two perspectives and examining the factors that build online trust in an environment that lacks the typical human interaction that often leads to trust in other circumstances advances our understanding of these constructs and their linkages to behavior. Our research on experienced repeat online shoppers shows that consumer trust is as important to online commerce as the widely accepted TAM use-antecedents, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Together these variable sets explain a considerable proportion of variance in intended behavior. The study also provides evidence that online trust is built through (1) a belief that the vendor has nothing to gain by cheating, (2) a belief that there are safety mechanisms built into the Web site, and (3) by having a typical interface, (4) one that is, moreover, easy to use.},

Drawing on findings from research on virtual communities and traditional word-of-mouth literature, a typology for motives of consumer online articulation is developed. Using an online sample of some 2,000 consumers, information on the structure and relevance of the motives of consumers’ online articulations is generated. The resulting analysis suggests that consumers’ desire for social interaction, desire for economic incentives, their concern for other consumers, and the potential to enhance their own self-worth are the primary factors leading to eWOM behavior. Further, eWOM providers can be grouped based on what motivates their behavior, suggesting that firms may need to develop different strategies for encouraging eWOM behavior among their users.},

It provides opportunities to participate in society in ways otherwise not available. With accessible websites, people with disabilities can do ordinary things:children can learn, teenagers can flirt, adults can make a living, seniors can read about their grand- children, and so on. With the Web, people with disabilities can do more things themselves, without having to rely on others. People who are blind can read the newspaper (through screen readers that read aloud text from the computer), and so can people with cognitive disabilities who have trouble processing written information. People who are deaf can get up-to-the-minute news that was previously available only to those who could hear radio or TV, and so can people who are blind and deaf (through dynamic Braille displays). People with quadriplegia who cannot move their arms or legs can shop online to get groceries, gadgets, and gifts delivered. People who cannot speak can participate in online discus- sions, such as through blog comments.},

  abstract = {Negative impressions that arise during a first interaction with a Business-to-Customer web page often have the unpleasant side effect to destroy a firm's efforts in achieving B2C electronic commerce on the WWW. This paper verifies the relation between audience impressions and the visual style of a B2C web page. In comparison to previous work, the experimental procedure was greatly improved. It was therefore expected that this leads to improved results with higher reliability. Moreover, this study considered the impressions of Japanese, Chinese, and English subjects to investigate differences and consistencies in impressions, which are based on the underlying culture. Three empirical studies based on self-report questionnaires were conducted in Japan, China and the UK. The studies measured the subjects' impressions of various B2C web pages that showed eight design factors. The evaluation values for 17 impression factors and their antonym terms were collected in the questionnaires. The studies in China and the UK were conducted using the same procedure as in Japan. Sign tests of the results show a significant difference in subjects' impressions corresponding to changes in design factors. Moreover, the results show cross-cultural consistencies in various impressions but also several differences between the subject groups. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the empirical results for the visual design of international B2C web pages in terms of target impressions.},

  abstract = {Though several industry reports have suggested that the rate of shopping cart abandonment is high in the mobile channel, the reasons for such abandonment remain relatively unexplored. Drawing on the cognition-affect-behavior (CAB) paradigm, this study aims to provide a conceptual framework explaining why consumers hesitate to use mobile channels for shopping and thus abandon their mobile shopping carts. Results from two studies show that mobile shopping cart abandonment is positively influenced by emotional ambivalence, a result of consumers' conflicting thoughts. More specifically, emotional ambivalence amplifies consumers' hesitation at the checkout stage, leading to cart abandonment. However, if hesitant consumers are satisfied with the choice process during shopping, they are less likely to give up their mobile shopping carts. Based on the findings, this mobile channel study provides practical and theoretical implications for marketers and e-cart abandonment researchers, respectively.},

Several studies examined the impact of online instruction on students’ academic and socioemotional performance, whereas only limited research evidence exists concerning the performance of university students with disabilities (SWD) during online learning. This exploratory qualitative study aims to understand the experiences of nine undergraduate SWD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We compared and contrasted our study findings with existing literature on creating equitable academic environments and reducing access barriers for all students.},

  abstract  = {Purpose This paper analyzes the effect of company response style and complaint source on silent observers' reactions to a service failure episode vented on Twitter. Design/methodology/approach In a 2 {\texttimes} 2 experimental design, company response style (personalized vs automatic) and complaint source (ordinary Twitter user vs influencer) were manipulated to test the hypotheses. Findings Complaint source moderates the effect of company response style on brand image, purchase intention and electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). Thus, the authors found that a personalized response to a complaint, compared to an automatic response, leads to a more favorable brand image as well as purchase intention and eWOM intention when the complainant is an ordinary Twitter user. However, the automatic response, compared to the personalized one, is better perceived when the complainant is an influencer. The authors also found that service failure response attribution and the emotions elicited during the firm--complainant interaction mediate the previous effects. Research limitations/implications This paper deals with the company's initial reaction after a complaint is posted on Twitter; however, the complaint-handling process is longer, and both the customer and silent observers await a resolution. Future research could tackle subsequent stages of the process and different recovery strategies. Practical implications The study offers meaningful insights regarding complaint handling on Twitter and how the effectiveness of the company response style depends on the complaint source. Marketers should offer adapted personalized responses to prompt positive behavioral intentions for ordinary Twitter users, who represent prospective consumers. However, a personalized response given to an influencer may be perceived more negatively, as silent observers may interpret that the company offers such a response just because the complaint comes from a well-known person who can reach many users and not because of an honest interest in serving consumers. Originality/value This research focuses on the underresearched area of the impact of online complaints on silent observers, a large group of prospective consumers quietly exposed to complaints aired on Twitter. The underlying mechanisms are also identified.},

In this research, we empirically model the individual's decision to provide a product rating and investigate factors that influence this decision. Specifically, we consider how previously posted ratings may affect an individual's posting behavior in terms of whether to contribute (incidence) and what to contribute (evaluation), and we identify selection effects that influence the incidence decision and adjustment effects that influence the evaluation decision. Across individuals, our results show that positive ratings environments increase posting incidence, whereas negative ratings environments discourage posting. Our results also indicate important differences across individuals in how they respond to previously posted ratings, with less frequent posters exhibiting bandwagon behavior and more active customers revealing differentiation behavior. These dynamics affect the evolution of online product opinions. Through simulations, we illustrate how the evolution of posted product opinions is shaped by the underlying customer base and show that customer bases with the same median opinion may evolve in substantially different ways because of the presence of a core group of “activists” posting increasingly negative opinions.},

While Twitter has traditionally been thought of as the most accessible social media platform for blind users, Twitter's increasing integration of image content and users' diverse uses for images have presented emergent accessibility challenges. Our findings illuminate the importance of the ability to use social media for people who are blind, while also highlighting the many challenges such media currently present this user base, including difficulty in creating profiles, in awareness of available features and settings, in controlling revelations of one's disability status, and in dealing with the increasing pervasiveness of image-based content.

  abstract = {The high rates of online shopping abandonment are a major problem in a trillion dollar industry. In this research we focused on the extent to which choice conflicts influence online shopping cart abandonment. We began by investigating exploratorily the nature, frequency, and sources of choice conflicts as they manifest themselves in the online environment. Next, we studied experimentally the effects of choice conflicts on the shopping cart abandonment using a custom developed webshop to replicate a real online shopping session. For this purpose, we used a 2x3 factorial experimental setup and we analyzed data from 164 participants. We found that choice conflicts were not a direct cause of online shopping abandonment. Instead, results indicate that with each experienced choice conflict, the chance of a perceived higher decision difficulty increased 17 times. Subsequently, a perceived higher level of decision difficulty increased the chance of abandoning the shopping cart by 22%. Additionally, we found that the effort to search information and product attribute alignment also influenced the perceived decision difficulty; at the same time, maximizing behavior was identified as the main source of choice conflicts. The resulting research model illustrates the conjoint effect of choice conflicts and perceived decision difficulty on increasing the chance of online shopping abandonment. We found that displaying products with nonaligned attributes decreased the perceived decision difficulty and reduced the chance of shopping abandonment. Further research is needed to develop methods to lower the chance of experiencing choice conflicts and high decision difficulties.},

Despite these concerns, there is a lack of empirical research on the effects of current Web accessibility guidelines on nondisabled users.Method:Sixty-one nondisabled participants used one of three Web sites differing in levels of accessibility (high, low, and very low). Accessibility levels were determined by following established Web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0). A broad methodological approach was used, including performance measures (e.g., task completion time) and user ratings (e.g., perceived usability).Results:A high level of Web accessibility led to better performance (i.e., task completion time and task completion rate) than low or very low accessibility. Likewise, high Web accessibility improved user ratings (i.e., perceived usability, aesthetics, workload, and trustworthiness) compared to low or very low Web accessibility. There was no difference between the very low and low Web accessibility conditions for any of the outcome measures.Conclusion:Contrary to some concerns in the literature and among practitioners, high conformance with Web accessibility guidelines may provide benefits to users without disabilities.Application:The findings may encourage more practitioners to implement WCAG 2.0 for the benefit of users with disabilities and nondisabled users.},

Until recently, the Web community has been a male dominated western-oriented society, with the design of Web sites reflecting that homogenous audience. Using an adapted version of Hofstede's dimensions as a means of differentiation, this study explores the perception and satisfaction levels of one hundred and sixty subjects on four web sites. Analysis indicates that perception and satisfaction differences exist between the cultural clusters and gender groups within those cultures --- Asia, Europe, Latin &amp; South America, and North America. In particular, the perceptions of the Asian and Latin/South American were found to be similar, as were the perceptions of the Europeans and North Americans. Qualitative analysis indicates that females within certain cultures have widely different preferences from their male counterparts regarding web site attributes.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a process model for developing usable cross-cultural websites. Compatible with ISO 13407, the process model documents an abstraction of the design process focusing on cultural issues in development. It provides a framework in which a variety of user-based and expert-based techniques for analysis and design are placed within the life-cycle of website development. In developing the model, we relate practical approaches to design with theories and models of culture and discuss the relevance of such theories to the practical design process. In particular we focus on four key concerns: how an audit of local website attractors can inform the design process; the concept of a cultural fingerprint to contrast websites with the cultural needs of local users; the problems associated with user evaluation; and cross-cultural team development. We then show their relation to our process model. We conclude by summarising our contribution to date within the field.},

  abstract  = {In recent years online shopping has grown significantly worldwide. As the technology advanced, new techniques such as (HTML 5 and Flash-based content, JavaScript etc.) are used in e-commerce websites to visually present information. However, these new techniques have accessibility problems for people with disabilities when accessed using assistive technology. Therefore, it is also important to adopt web accessibility such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) in business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce websites to increase the consumer's satisfaction of all ages and with disabilities. This study analyses 30 Australian B2C websites in accordance to WCAG 2.0 using an automated web service. The result shows that B2C websites in Australia are not paying attention to web accessibility for people with disabilities. However, e-commerce will succeed in meeting WCAG 2.0 by making B2C e-commerce websites accessible to consumer of all ages and with disabilities. Recommendations are proposed in order to improve web accessibility for people with sensory (hearing and vision), motor (limited use of hands) and cognition (language and learning) disabilities in B2C e-commerce websites.},

  abstract  = {AbstractThe purpose of this study is to investigate online purchase intention in emerging markets focusing on the impact of perceived usefulness of online reviews, trust and perceived risk. The results were obtained by an online survey answered by 380 online shoppers in Mexico City. Results from partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS indicate that perceived usefulness of online reviews influences in trust and online purchase intention. Trust has an inverse relationship with perceived risk and influences positively in online purchase intention. The authors did not find perceived risk to influence directly in online purchase intention. The results suggest that companies should seek to enhance customers to share their positive online opinions in order to improve trust and encourage online purchases. This paper contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the influence on online purchase intention in emerging markets.},

  abstract = {Despite the widespread prevalence of online shopping cart abandonment (OSCA) and allusions to this behavior in popular press, scholars have yet to examine the key determinants of OSCA. This study used the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model to explore the factors influencing consumers' OSCA and decision to buy from a land-based retailer. Two studies were carried out to test the proposed hypotheses among Mainland China's Generation Y consumers. Data was collected based on two product categories (i.e., apparel and electrical appliances) at two different time scenarios (i.e., pre- and post-pandemic). The findings reveal that hesitation at checkout increases OSCA, while consumers' decision to buy from a land-based retailer is influenced by their emotional ambivalence and OSCA. Furthermore, fear appeals appear to weaken the relationship between OSCA and the decision to buy from a land-based retailer. This study has implications for researchers and practitioners who seek to effectively reduce the rate of OSCA.},

  abstract  = {In the modern era where computers play a prominent role in day to day life, visually disabled users have found it challenging to keep up with the modern advancements in computers and internet usage forming a `digital divide'. Project Nethra is an intelligent virtual assistant for the visually disabled, which provides a voice based medium for visually disabled users. It allows the target users to interact with computers and internet based services with a wide array of functionality based on various internet services and social media. With Nethra, tasks will be done for the user instead of just returning search results. Project Nethra will listen and detect what the user says and responds to user's requests in a friendly, effective manner via voice in a manner of a conversation. There are four main components of the system; the voice recognition module, the natural language processing module, conversational agent and the content extraction module. This is a much faster and interactive solution than regular assistive software for the visually disabled. The existing screen reader software are not suitable for accessing World Wide Web because of the minimum support they provide for web content and the lack of voice recognition. The Virtual Assistant software available in the market are not specifically catered for visually disabled. All the mainstream solutions were analyzed and compared with project Nethra in order to substantiate that the proposed solution is the most optimal and would bridge the `digital divide' that exists between sighted and visually disabled users.},

  abstract = {Abstract The easy exchange of rich information between often geographically dispersed parties is an important precursor of successful tourism transactions. Internet-based technologies, in particular the World Wide Web, offer possibilities to both buyers and sellers to exchange information without the constraints of geography and time diminishing its richness. The disabled, representing a significant part of any marketplace, may, however, have difficulties accessing the content of the Web and therefore sharing the benefits of rich information exchange. This is the principal concern of ‘Web content accessibility’. Focusing on the tourism sector, in particular UK-based hotels, this paper examines the accessibility of their websites. However, recognising that it is not just access to information that is important for the disabled, but also the quality of that information, the paper also examines the extent to which the information contained on websites serves their particular needs. Utilising the accessibility testing software ‘Bobby’, disappointingly low levels of Web content accessibility were found amongst the sample of websites. Against a framework of information needs developed from criteria provided by disability organisations, the sample also revealed disappointingly low levels of specific (relevant) information for the disabled.

  abstract = {Online comments have become an important tool for disabled guests because of lower physical movement requirements. In order to illustrate and evaluate disabled guests' decision-making characteristics, this paper has used two steps for studying: (1) Data mining technology to collect e-comments from C-trip (www.ctrip.com) of 97 hotels in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Guangzhou. Over 260,000 words were collected and analyzed by using ROSTcm software for this research. (2) Examined the relationship between the credibility and the perceived risk of disabled guests for their behavioral intentions. The result of this study has showed that: (1) Disabled guests pay more attention to the hotel barrier-free facilities, hotel barrier-free facilities, hotel personalized service, location accessibility, and the attitude and atmosphere of the hotel. (2) Disabled guests show positive attitude towards the hotel, and a neutral attitude accounting for 25.86{\%} which indicates that the hotel industry still has much improving room especially with regards to disabled accessible guestrooms and accessibility. (3) Electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) source credibility has a great influence on the overall perceived risk of the review of disabled guests because they are more likely for seeking internet comments for their lodging decision-making than other common guests. eWOM rational management can reduce the overall potential risk for disabled guests. (4) Hotels can enhance disabled guests' decision-making by advanced eWOM management. The study illustrated that disabled guests who used eWOM could be better managed and reduce potential risks when making decisions. As a result, this study also found that with better management of eWOM, it could help to meet the potential market for the disabled guests and at the meanwhile attract more customers because of higher social reputation.},
