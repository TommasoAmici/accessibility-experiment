This repo contains my Master's thesis for the MSc in Business Administration at the Amsterdam Business School.

# Getting started

This is a LaTeX project so you'll need to install the following dependencies (instructions for macOS):

```sh
brew install texlive biber
# optional for automatically indenting latex documents
brew install latexindent
```

I used VSCode with [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop), but you should be able to build it with `make build` as well.

## Experiment

The [experiment](./experiment) directory contains the source code of a Next.js application
I built to test my hypotheses related to web accessibility.
